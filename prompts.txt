I want to build a conversational AI agent using "microsoft agent framework" and python. The agent will be used by management within my company to ask about GitHub copilot usage of the company's 6000 developers. The agent should analyse historic github copilot data I've obtained from github APIs and saved to CSV files. 

The data includes which developers have used github copilot each month, along with number of requests and which models are being used. 

There are multiple CSV files. For example, there's a CSV file that shows which developers have used github copilot each month, and identifies the segment of each developer. Another CSV shows the number of requests and lines of code suggested and accepted for each request or chat made.

Show the architecture for a solution I can implement using the microsoft agent framework. Should I also create an MCP server as part of the solution?
